# IMPORTANT NOTES

THE FOLLOWING DOCUMENTATION IS A HELP TO EXECUTE AND PROBE THE RESULT OF THE IEEE LATIN AMERICA PAPER CALLED "Fractional-Order Control for Voltage Regulation in Bidirectional Converters An Experimental Study" WITH ID 8468

## MATLAB FILES
	a. Boost_aproximation.m Mat function with the code to generate the FOPID and fractional aproximation of Boost converter.
 	b. Buck_aproximation.m Mat function with the code to generate the FOPID and fractional aproximation of Buck converter.
  	c. Main_function.m Main script to set the parameters of each converter and escecute both function. Note: the parameters can be modified by user
   	d. Variables global variables used in each Mat function.
 
## INSTRUCTIONS TO DESIGN THE FOPID
## INSTRUCTIONS TO EXECUTE A CORRECT TEST OF THE FOPID
## PSEUDO CODE TO HELP THE CODING THE FOPID IN A MICROCONTROLLER
## LIST OF MATERIAL AND EQUIMENT
